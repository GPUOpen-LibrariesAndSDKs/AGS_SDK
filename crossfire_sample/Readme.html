        <h1>Crossfire API sample</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Crossfire API sample, which shows how to use the Crossfire API.</p>
        <section>
            <h2>Installation</h2>
            <p>Make sure a driver with Crossfire API support is installed and that Crossfire is enabled in Radeon Settings.</p>
            <p class="note">If Crossfire is not enabled in Radeon Settings, the extension will not load, and the AGS_DX11_EXTENSION_CROSSFIRE_API flag will not be set.</p>
        </section>

            <h2>How does the sample work?</h2>
            <p>The sample has a texture/render-target (<code>texture_</code>) which is updated in every <em>odd</em> frame by rendering into it. On a Crossfire system running in alternate frame rendering (AFR), the rendering will happen only on one GPU and hence the application will exhibit flickering.</p>
            <p>The Crossfire API solves this by allowing the developer to mark up the resource for copy.</p>
            <p>The Crossfire API consists of three main entry points:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><code>NotifyResourceBeginAllAccess</code>: Called before the first use of a resource. Ensures a copy is finished at this point.</li>
                <li><code>NotifyResourceEndWrites</code>: Called after the last write access to a resource. After this point, the resource can be copied.</li>
                <li><code>NotifyResourceEndAllAccess</code>: Called after the last read access to a resource. While a resource is being accessed, it cannot be updated from another GPU.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Here's an illustration of the process. The boxes indicate frames, the orange area is the time between begin/end any access and the striped region is the time between begin and end write access. The left-hand side is the normal case, where the copy is initiated immediately after the write access has ended so it's available in time on the second GPU.</p>
            <p>The right-hand side illustrates why the <code>EndAnyAccess</code> is needed. Without it, the copy would overwrite the resource while it's still in use on GPU 0. With <code>EndAnyAccess</code>, it can be properly delayed until GPU 0 is done using it.</p>
