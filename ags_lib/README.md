<img src="doc/amd_logo_black.png" width="512" height="123" />

The AMD GPU Services (AGS) library provides software developers with the ability to query AMD GPU software and hardware state information that is not normally available through standard operating systems or graphic APIs. Version 3.1 of the library includes support for querying graphics driver version info, GPU performance, Crossfire&trade; (AMD's multi-GPU rendering technology) configuration info, and Eyefinity (AMD's multi-display rendering technology) configuration info. AGS also exposes the explicit Crossfire API, as well as additional functionality supported in the AMD driver for DirectX 11.

This version of the AGS library is just the documentation, header file, import libraries, and DLLs. For the full AGS SDK, which includes samples, visit the AGS SDK repository:
